Natasha Brookes is a Learning and Development Specialist at Vodafone. For her, it was clear that a digital marketing course needed an online solution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVodafone is a large global organization. In order to reach all of the marketers within the different markets, what better way to do it than having one place where marketers can come and learn? And it will be a consistent learning approach.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;60px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Solution&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]The Digital Marketing Institute realized early on that Vodafone is a company that wants to set the pace, not just keep up with it. They didn\u2019t just want a foundation to their digital marketing, they also wanted to train their staff to be up-to-date and current in their knowledge and skills, so they could anticipate what their customers would want.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had the greatest degree of confidence in the Digital Marketing Institute, both in terms of quality of content and their global certification standard, which we could apply across all of our markets,\u201d stated Ghafoor<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Vodafone Marketing Academy had a learning management system, or e-learning system, already set up. Having a learning management system meant that their staff already knew the benefits of learning online. The next step was to find the right partner, to provide the content the company needed.<\/p>\n<p>To get Vodafone started, The Digital Marketing Institute began by carefully picking topics and courses that were most relevant to Vodafone and their staff. They then agreed a global user license that gave Vodafone\u2019s staff access to 15 of the DMI modules. Their staff could choose from modules in both the Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing and from the Specialist Diplomas.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;60px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Results&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]The Digital Marketing Institute team then worked with Vodafone to integrate core modules and content into their e-learning system to make it easy for their global workforce to train together, wherever they were, and whenever it suited. The video-based learning content is now used by Vodafone Marketing Academy staff all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>A launch was also successfully supported by with a range of creative promotions \u2013 from e-flyers to newsletters and helped generate awareness and enthusiasm for the courses through internal campaigns. Today, The Digital Marketing Institute continues to work with Vodafone to certify their workforce, and help the company realize their full digital potential.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI found the relationship to be a really positive one. One that was constructive. It certainly felt to me that what I was saying about Vodafone\u2019s needs and requirements in this space was being listened to,\u201d concluded Mohsin.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_cu","protected":false},"featured_media":649,"template":"","nproject-category":[54],"nproject-tag":[68,63,65],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject\/647"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/nproject"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/649"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=647"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"nproject-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject-category?post=647"},{"taxonomy":"nproject-tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.21lab.co\/nanosoft\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject-tag?post=647"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
